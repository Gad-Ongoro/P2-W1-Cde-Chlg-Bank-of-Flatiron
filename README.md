## User stories
### As a user, I can:
* See a table of the transactions.
* Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence.
* Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
